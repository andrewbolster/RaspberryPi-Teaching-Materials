A free open source piece of software for prototyping and making PCBs.

All PCBs are currently UNTESTED. Use at your own risk.

The final ready to use designs can be found in the PNGs folder.
The designs are designed for use with the Roland Modela MDX-20 so also include drilling PNGs to allow you to auto drill the PCBs.
